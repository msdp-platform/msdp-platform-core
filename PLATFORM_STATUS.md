## 🏗️ **Microservice Architecture Compliance**

### **✅ Principles Followed**
- **🐳 Containerization**: All services running in Docker
- **🔒 Data Ownership**: Each service owns its database
- **🌐 API Communication**: RESTful APIs between services
- **🎯 Single Responsibility**: Each service has clear purpose
- **📊 Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed separately
- **🔐 Security**: JWT authentication across all services
- **📈 Scalability**: Docker-based horizontal scaling ready

### **✅ Service Communication**
```
Customer Frontend (4002) 
    ↓ JWT Authentication
User Service (3003) ← → Order Service (3006) ← → Payment Service (3007)
    ↑                        ↓
Admin Dashboard (4000)   Real Orders & Payments
```
