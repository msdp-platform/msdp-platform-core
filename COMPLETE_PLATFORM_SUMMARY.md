## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Microservice Design Principles Implemented**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each service has clear, focused purpose
- ✅ **Data Ownership** - Each service owns its database completely
- ✅ **API Communication** - RESTful APIs for all service interactions
- ✅ **Independent Deployment** - Services can be deployed separately
- ✅ **Containerization** - All services run in Docker containers
- ✅ **Shared Authentication** - JWT tokens work across all services
- ✅ **Database per Service** - No shared databases between services
- ✅ **Service Isolation** - Failure in one service doesn't affect others

### **Service Communication Flow**
```
Customer Frontend (4002)
    ↓ HTTP/JWT
User Service (3003) ←→ Order Service (3006) ←→ Payment Service (3007)
    ↑ HTTP/JWT              ↓ HTTP/Internal           ↓ HTTP/Internal
Admin Dashboard (4000)  Merchant Service (3002)   Loopback Gateway
```

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js 18, Express.js, PostgreSQL 15
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PgAdmin management
- **Development**: Hot reload, volume mounts, health checks
